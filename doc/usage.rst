This section describe usage of Jbuilder from the shell.

.. _finding-root:

Finding the root
================

.. _jbuild-workspace:

jbuild-workspace
----------------

The root of the current workspace is determined by looking up a
``jbuild-workspace`` or ``dune-project`` file in the current directory
and parent directories.

``jbuilder`` prints out the root when starting if it is not the
current directory:

.. code:: bash

    $ jbuilder runtest
    Entering directory '/home/jdimino/code/jbuilder'
    ...

More precisely, it will choose the outermost ancestor directory containing a
``jbuild-workspace`` file as root. For instance if you are in
``/home/me/code/myproject/src``, then jbuilder will look for all these files in
order:

-  ``/jbuild-workspace``
-  ``/home/jbuild-workspace``
-  ``/home/me/jbuild-workspace``
-  ``/home/me/code/jbuild-workspace``
-  ``/home/me/code/myproject/jbuild-workspace``
-  ``/home/me/code/myproject/src/jbuild-workspace``

The first entry to match in this list will determine the root. In
practice this means that if you nest your workspaces, Jbuilder will
always use the outermost one.

In addition to determining the root, ``jbuilder`` will read this file as to
setup the configuration of the workspace unless the ``--workspace`` command line
option is used. See the section `Workspace configuration`_ for the syntax of
this file.

jbuild-workspace\*
------------------

The following is deprecated and no longer works with ``dune``.

In addition to the previous rule, if no ``jbuild-workspace`` file is found,
``jbuilder`` will look for any file whose name starts with ``jbuild-workspace``
in ancestor directories. For instance ``jbuild-workspace.dev``. If such a file
is found, it will mark the root of the workspace. ``jbuilder`` will however not
read its contents.

 The rationale for this rule is that it is good practice to have a
``jbuild-workspace.dev`` file at the root of your project.

For quick experiments, simply do this to mark the root:

.. code:: bash

    $ touch jbuild-workspace.here

Current directory
-----------------

If none of the two previous rules appies, i.e. no ancestor directories
have a file whose name starts with ``jbuild-workspace``, then the
current directory will be used as root.

Forcing the root (for scripts)
------------------------------

You can pass the ``--root`` option to ``jbuilder`` to select the root
explicitly. This option is intended for scripts to disable the automatic lookup.

Note that when using the ``--root`` option, targets given on the command line
will be interpreted relative to the given root, not relative to the current
directory as this is normally the case.

Interpretation of targets
=========================

This section describes how ``jbuilder`` interprets the targets given on
the command line.

Resolution
----------

All targets that Jbuilder knows how to build live in the ``_build``
directory.  Although, some are sometimes copied to the source tree for
the need of external tools. These includes:

- ``.merlin`` files

- ``<package>.install`` files

As a result, if you want to ask ``jbuilder`` to produce a particular ``.exe``
file you would have to type:

.. code:: bash

    $ jbuilder build _build/default/bin/prog.exe

However, for convenience when a target on the command line doesn't
start with ``_build``, ``jbuilder`` will expand it to the
corresponding target in all the build contexts where it knows how to
build it. When using ``--verbose``, It prints out the actual set of
targets when starting:

.. code:: bash

    $ jbuilder build bin/prog.exe --verbose
    ...
    Actual targets:
    - _build/default/bin/prog.exe
    - _build/4.03.0/bin/prog.exe
    - _build/4.04.0/bin/prog.exe

Aliases
-------

Targets starting with a ``@`` are interpreted as aliases. For instance
``@src/runtest`` means the alias ``runtest`` in all descendant of
``src`` in all build contexts where it is defined. If you want to
refer to a target starting with a ``@``, simply write: ``./@foo``.

To build and run the tests for a particular build context, use
``@_build/default/runtest`` instead.

So for instance:

-  ``jbuilder build @_build/foo/runtest`` will run the tests only for
   the ``foo`` build context
-  ``jbuilder build @runtest`` will run the tests for all build contexts

Finding external libraries
==========================

When a library is not available in the workspace, jbuilder will look it
up in the installed world, and expect it to be already compiled.

It looks up external libraries using a specific list of search pathes. A
list of search pathes is specific to a given build context and is
determined as follow:

#. if the ``ocamlfind`` is present in the ``PATH`` of the context, use each line
   in the output of ``ocamlfind printconf path`` as a search path
#. otherwise, if ``opam`` is present in the ``PATH``, use the outout of ``opam
   config var lib``
#. otherwise, take the directory where ``ocamlc`` was found, and append
   ``../lib`` to it. For instance if ``ocamlc`` is found in ``/usr/bin``, use
   ``/usr/lib``

.. _running-tests:

Running tests
=============

There are two ways to run tests:

-  ``jbuilder build @runtest``
-  ``jbuilder runtest``

The two commands are equivalent. They will run all the tests defined in
the current directory and its children recursively. You can also run the
tests in a specific sub-directory and its children by using:

-  ``jbuilder build @foo/bar/runtest``
-  ``jbuilder runtest foo/bar``

Launching the Toplevel (REPL)
=============================

jbuilder supports launching a `utop <https://github.com/diml/utop>`__ instance
with locally defined libraries loaded.

.. code:: bash

   $ jbuilder utop <dir> -- <args>

Where ``<dir>`` is a directory containing a ``jbuild`` file defining all the
libraries that will be loaded (using the ``library`` stanza). ``<args>`` will be
passed as arguments to the utop command itself. For example, to launch it in
emacs mode.

Requirements & Limitations
--------------------------

* utop version >= 2.0 is required for this to work.
* This subcommand only supports loading libraries. Executables aren't supported.
* Libraries that are dependencies of utop itself cannot be loaded. For example
  `Camomile <https://github.com/yoriyuki/Camomile>`__.
* Loading libraries that are defined in different directories into one utop
  instance isn't possible.

Restricting the set of packages
===============================

You can restrict the set of packages from your workspace that Jbuilder
can see with the ``--only-packages`` option:

.. code:: bash

    $ jbuilder build --only-packages pkg1,pkg2,... @install

This option acts as if you went through all the jbuild files and
commented out the stanzas refering to a package that is not in the list
given to ``jbuilder``.

Invocation from opam
====================

You should set the ``build:`` field of your ``<package>.opam`` file as
follows:

::

    build: [["jbuilder" "build" "-p" name "-j" jobs]]

``-p pkg`` is a shorthand for ``--root . --only-packages pkg --profile
release``. ``-p`` is the short version of
``--for-release-of-packages``.

This has the following effects:

-  it tells jbuilder to build everything that is installable and to
   ignore packages other than ``name`` defined in your project
-  it sets the root to prevent jbuilder from looking it up
-  it sets the build profile to ``release``
-  it uses whatever concurrency option opam provides

Note that ``name`` and ``jobs`` are variables expanded by opam. ``name``
expands to the package name and ``jobs`` to the number of jobs available
to build the package.

Tests
=====

To setup the building and running of tests in opam, add this line to
your ``<package>.opam`` file:

::

    build-test: [["jbuilder" "runtest" "-p" name "-j" jobs]]

Installation
============

Installing a package means copying the build artifacts from the build
directory to the installed word.

When installing via opam, you don't need to worry about this step:
jbuilder generates a ``<package>.install`` file that opam will
automatically read to handle installation.

However, when not using opam or doing local development, you can use
jbuilder to install the artifacts by hands. To do that, use the
``install`` command:

::

    $ jbuilder install [PACKAGE]...

without an argument, it will install all the packages available in the
workspace. With a specific list of packages, it will only install these
packages. If several build contexts are configured, the installation
will be performed for all of them.

Note that ``jbuilder install`` is a thin wrapper around the
``opam-installer`` tool, so you will need to install this tool in order
to be able to use ``jbuilder install``.

Destination
-----------

The place where the build artifacts are copied, usually referred as
**prefix**, is determined as follow for a given build context:

#. if an explicit ``--prefix <path>`` argument is passed, use this path
#. if ``opam`` is present in the ``PATH`` and is configured, use the
   output of ``opam config var prefix``
#. otherwise, take the parent of the directory where ``ocamlc`` was found.

As an exception to this rule, library files might be copied to a
different location. The reason for this is that they often need to be
copied to a particular location for the various build system used in
OCaml projects to find them and this location might be different from
``<prefix>/lib`` on some systems.

Historically, the location where to store OCaml library files was
configured through `findlib
<http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/findlib.html>`__ and the
``ocamlfind`` command line tool was used to both install these files
and locate them. Many Linux distributions or other packaging systems
are using this mechanism to setup where OCaml library files should be
copied.

As a result, if none of ``--libdir`` and ``--prefix`` is passed to
``jbuilder install`` and ``ocamlfind`` is present in the ``PATH``,
then library files will be copied to the directory reported by
``ocamlfind printconf destdir``. This ensures that ``jbuilder
install`` can be used without opam. When using opam, ``ocamlfind`` is
configured to point to the opam directory, so this rule makes no
difference.

Note that ``--prefix`` and ``--libdir`` are only supported if a single
build context is in use.

Workspace configuration
=======================

By default, a workspace has only one build context named ``default``
which correspond to the environment in which ``jbuilder`` is run. You
can define more contexts by writing a ``jbuild-workspace`` file.

You can point ``jbuilder`` to an explicit ``jbuild-workspace`` file with
the ``--workspace`` option. For instance it is good practice to write a
``jbuild-workspace.dev`` in your project with all the version of OCaml
your projects support. This way developers can tests that the code
builds with all version of OCaml by simply running:

.. code:: bash

    $ jbuilder build --workspace jbuild-workspace.dev @install @runtest

jbuild-workspace
----------------

The ``jbuild-workspace`` file uses the S-expression syntax. This is what
a typical ``jbuild-workspace`` file looks like:

.. code:: scheme

    (context (opam (switch 4.02.3)))
    (context (opam (switch 4.03.0)))
    (context (opam (switch 4.04.0)))

The rest of this section describe the stanzas available.

Note that an empty ``jbuild-workspace`` file is interpreted the same
as one containing exactly:

.. code:: scheme

    (context default)

This allows you to use an empty ``jbuild-workspace`` file to mark
the root of your project.

profile
~~~~~~~

The build profile can be selected in the ``jbuild-workspace`` file by
write a ``(profile ...)`` stanza. For instance:

.. code:: scheme

    (profile dev)

Note that the command line option ``--profile`` has precedence over
this stanza.

context
~~~~~~~

The ``(context ...)`` stanza declares a build context. The argument
can be either ``default`` or ``(default)`` for the default build
context or can be the description of an opam switch, as follows:

.. code:: scheme

    (context (opam (switch <opam-switch-name>)
                   <optional-fields>))

``<optional-fields>`` are:

-  ``(name <name>)`` is the name of the subdirectory of ``_build``
   where the artifacts for this build context will be stored

-  ``(root <opam-root>)`` is the opam root. By default it will take
   the opam root defined by the environment in which ``jbuilder`` is
   run which is usually ``~/.opam``

- ``(merlin)`` instructs Jbuilder to use this build context for
   merlin

- ``(profile <profile>)`` to set a different profile for a build
  context. This has precedence over the command line option
  ``--profile``

Both ``(default ...)`` and ``(opam ...)`` accept a ``targets`` field
in order to setup cross compilation. See `Cross Compilation`_ for more
information.

Merlin reads compilation artifacts and it can only read the
compilation artifacts of a single context.  Usually, you should use
the artifacts from the ``default`` context, and if you have the
``(context default)`` stanza in your ``jbuild-workspace`` file, that
is the one Jbuilder will use.

For rare cases where this is not what you want, you can force Jbuilder
to use a different build contexts for merlin by adding the field
``(merlin)`` to this context.

Note that the following syntax is still accepted but is deprecated:

.. code:: scheme

    (context ((switch <opam-switch-name>)
              <optional-fields>))

it is interpreted the same as ``(context (opam (switch ...) ...))``.

Building JavaScript with js_of_ocaml
====================================

Jbuilder knows how to generate a JavaScript version of an executable
(``<name>.bc.js``) using the js_of_ocaml compiler (the ``js_of_ocaml-compiler``
opam package must be installed).

It supports two modes of compilation:

- Direct compilation of a bytecode program to JavaScript. This mode allows
  js_of_ocaml to perform whole program deadcode elimination and whole program
  inlining.
- Separate compilation, where compilation units are compiled to JavaScript
  separately and then linked together. This mode is useful during development as
  it builds more quickly.

The separate compilation mode will be selected when passing ``--dev`` to
jbuilder. There is currently no other way to control this behaviour.

See the section about :ref:`jbuild-jsoo` for passing custom flags to the
js_of_ocaml compiler

.. _using-topkg:

Using topkg with jbuilder
=========================

Jbuilder provides suport for building and installing your project.
However it doesn't provides helpers for distributing it. It is
recommemded to use `Topkg <https://github.com/dbuenzli/topkg>`__ for
this purpose.

The `topkg-jbuilder <https://github.com/diml/topkg-jbuilder>`__
project provides helpers for using Topkg in a Jbuilder project. In
particular, as long as your project uses the common defaults, just
write this ``pkg/pkg.ml`` file and you are all set:

.. code:: ocaml

    #use "topfind"
    #require "topkg-jbuilder.auto"

It is planned that this file won't be necessary at all soon and topkg
will work out of the box on jbuilder projects.

The common defaults are that your projects include the following
files:

- ``README.md``
- ``CHANGES.md``
- ``LICENSE.md``

And that if your project contains several packages, then all the
package names must be prefixed by the shortest one.

Watermarking
~~~~~~~~~~~~

One of the feature topkg provides is watermarking; it replaces various
strings of the form ``%%ID%%`` in all files of your project before
creating a release tarball or when the package is pinned by the user
using opam.

This is especially interesting for the ``VERSION`` watermark, which
gets replaced by the version obtained from the vcs. For instance if
you are using git, topkg invokes this command to find out the version:

.. code:: bash

    $ git describe --always --dirty
    1.0+beta9-79-g29e9b37

Projects using jbuilder usually only need topkg for creating and
publishing releases. However they might still want to substitute the
watermarks when the package is pinned by the user. To help with this,
jbuilder provides the ``subst`` sub-command.

jbuilder subst
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``jbuilder subst`` performs the same substitution ``topkg`` does with
the default configuration. i.e. calling ``jbuilder subst`` at the root
of your project will rewrite in place all the files in your project.

More precisely, it replaces all the following watermarks in source
files:

- ``NAME``, the name of the project
- ``VERSION``, output of ``git describe --always --dirty``
- ``VERSION_NUM``, same as ``VERSION`` but with a potential leading
  ``v`` or ``V`` dropped
- ``VCS_COMMIT_ID``, commit hash from the vcs
- ``PKG_MAINTAINER``, contents of the ``maintainer`` field from the
  opam file
- ``PKG_AUTHORS``, contents of the ``authors`` field from the opam file
- ``PKG_HOMEPAGE``, contents of the ``homepage`` field from the opam file
- ``PKG_ISSUES``, contents of the ``issues`` field from the opam file
- ``PKG_DOC``, contents of the ``doc`` field from the opam file
- ``PKG_LICENSE``, contents of the ``license`` field from the opam file
- ``PKG_REPO``, contents of the ``repo`` field from the opam file

Note that if your project contains several packages, ``NAME`` will
be replaced by the shorted package name as long as it is a prefix of
all the package names. If your package names don't follow this rule,
you need to specify the name explicitly via the ``-n`` flag:

.. code:: bash

    $ jbuilder subst -n myproject

Finally, note that jbuilder doesn't allow you to customize the list of
substituted watermarks. If you which to do so, you need to configure
topkg and use it instead of ``jbuilder subst``.
